        tasty pan sauce that adds extra flavor at the table.</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken Breasts</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Creole Seasoning</li>
        <li>Chicken Broth</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Coat the chicken breasts with olive oil, then sprinkle both sides with salt and Creole seasoning.</li>
        <li>Place the seasoned chicken in a broiler pan. Bake in an oven for about 10 minutes, then flip and 
            continue to bake for about 15 more minutes (or until the juices run clear). When the chicken is 
            done baking, transfer it to a plate.</li>
        <li>Pour the chicken broth into the pan you used to bake the chicken. Scrape any browned bits off 
            the side with a spatula. Drizzle the pan sauce over the baked chicken before serving.</li>
